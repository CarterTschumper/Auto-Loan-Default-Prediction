# ABOUT THE DATASET
The Auto Loan Defalt Prediction is a Jupyter Notebook using Python and multiple statistical packages to predict loan default on customers. Within the dataset I use Pandas, Sci-kit for data manipulation and computation, as well as MatPlotLib + Seaborn for visualization. As far as the regression and classification, I use Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Logistic Regression + Random Forest to predict auto loan defaults.

# HOW TO REPLICATE RESULTS
The ipynb Jupyter Notebook is included as "Auto Loan Default Prediction". If you would like to look at the results yourself and run all of my analysis, simply download the dataset and rerun it. The data is connected via the raw github data html so you do not need to download anything else.
